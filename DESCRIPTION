Description: The objective of this package is to show functions showing 
    how to calculate relative abundance of an object and plot it according to the 
    abundance per category. It contains a data frame I created of different 
    ingredients and another set of different medication types and how many of 
    each ingrediant is in each medication. The functions show how to find 
    the abundance while plotting a visual displaying that. The purpose is to 
    show how data collected can be used through functions to inform on relative
    abundance.
